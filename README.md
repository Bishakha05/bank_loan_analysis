# bank_loan_analysis
<p>This is a Bank Loan analysis project using python's data analysis tools like matplotlib and  pandas. </p>

<p>
In this project we learn about the Key Performace Indictors(KPIs) requirement :
<ul> <u> Total Loan Applications: </u> We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications. </ul>
<ul> <h2> Total Funded Amount: </h2> Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount metric. </ul>
<ul> <h2> Total Amount Received:  </h2>  Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Receive.</ul>
<ul> <h2> Average Interest Rate: </h2>   Calculating the average interest rate across all loans which will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
TUTORIALS</ul>
<ul> <h2> Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):</h2>   Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans.</ul>

<ul> <h2> Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI's</h2> </ul>
</p>

<p>
<h> Graphs used for data Visualization: </h2>

<ul> <h2> Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line/ Area Chart): </h2>   To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities</ul>

<ul> <h2>  Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart):  </h2>   To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities</ul>

<ul> <h2> Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):  </h2>   To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.</ul>

<ul> <h2>Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):  </h2>   How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.</ul>

<ul> <h2> Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):   </h2>   Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes
of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing</ul>

<ul> <h2> Home Ownership Analysis (Tree/ Heat Map):   </h2>    For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.</ul>
